# 04.14: OUTRO

And that's it, job done! We've taken an entirely `online only` site and made it an `offline first` Progressive Web Application! By making it to the end of this course, you're ready to take on ANY `offline first` project.

Wittr was specifically designed to cover most of the gnarly edge-cases you'll encounter in the "wild." For example:

* [x] Cache versioning for big updates like theme changes;
* [x] Interactive updates to get the user onto the latest version;
* [x] Dealing with server rendering by serving a page skeleton;
* [x] Responsive images
* [x] Multiple caches
* [x] You even had to master IndexedDB, the most feared API on the platform!

You did it all!

If the user was on some kind of non-perfect connection they used to have to wait for the page to appear, and imagery took ages! Now, stuff appears on the screen instantly. Lie-fi users used to be left staring at a white screen forever, but now they get content instantly. Offline users used to get a browser error page, but now they get content and a non-disruptive custom error. This is a huge improvement in the user experience!

If your site works `offline first`, users are going to notice that it loads reliably and fast whatever the network. They'll have a less frustrating experience with your site than the rest of the web, and that's what matters; the user experience!

We look.. forward to a we... b that works.. whatev...er the connec...tion i-
