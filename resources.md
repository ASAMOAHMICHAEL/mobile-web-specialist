  <summary><strong>On what basis are the top 1,000 students decided in the intermediate track?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    When phase one ends on April 10, Udacity and Google will review your work and progress from this initial part of the scholarship program. In general, we will allocate the follow-up scholarships to high performing students based on this criteria:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Successful completion of course material and quizzes. To be clear, there is no reward for finishing first or early. We will evaluate everyone's progress after the course ends in early April. This means making as much use of the forums as possible in order to iterate on your work.</li>
    
    <li>Support of fellow students and active participation in forums and on Slack. We have seen time and time again that the most successful students are those that learn in a community. We expect to see continuous engagement on Slack and the forums over the next three months.</li>
  </ul>

  <summary><strong>Between Slack and Forums, which one would be given more weight?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Both are important and quite distinct interactions, but in the end forum is more relevant because:

    <li>Here is the place to submit your projects for mentor feedback: https://discussions.udacity.com/t/project-feedback-from-mentors/511883</li>
    <li>Your activities on the forum are measurable by badges: https://discussions.udacity.com/badges</li>
