# 03.08: QUIZ: SERVICE WORKER DEV TOOLS 2
Once the task is complete, enter the Task ID: **sw-active**

## CODING TASK
Your next challenge is to get that new Service Worker active. That means closing all the windows that are using the current Service Worker or navigating those windows to a page that isn't in the Service Worker's scope. Take a look at the `Application` tab in Chrome's developer tools again and select `Service Workers`. At this point, you should see an active Service Worker and no longer see a Service Worker waiting.
