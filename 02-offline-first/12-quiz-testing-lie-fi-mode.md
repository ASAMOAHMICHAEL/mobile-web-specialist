# 02.12: QUIZ: TESTING LIE-FI MODE
If you have not done so already, make sure you have started the server with:

```shell
$ npm run serve
```

  - Navigate your browser to: http://localhost:8888/
  - Open a new tab to: http://localhost:8889/

Make sure the project is working correctly and you can alter the connectivity with the configuration options.

Use the connection controls to get the app server into lie-fi mode and refresh the app. Type **lie-fi** into the test field and press ENTER.
