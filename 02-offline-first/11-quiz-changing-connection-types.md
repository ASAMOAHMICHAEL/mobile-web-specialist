# 02.11: QUIZ: CHANGING CONNECTION TYPES
If you have not done so already, make sure you have started the server with:

```shell
$ npm run serve
```

  - Navigate your browser to: http://localhost:8888/
  - Open a new tab to: http://localhost:8889/

Make sure the project is working correctly and you can alter the connectivity with the configuration options.

Use the connection controls to get the app server into offline mode and refresh the app. Type **offline** into the test field and press ENTER.
