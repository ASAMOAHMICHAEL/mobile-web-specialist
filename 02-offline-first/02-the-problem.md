# 02.02: THE PROBLEM
Wittr is the demonstration application we will be working on in this course. It is a PWA which is accessible from mobile home screens and is available offline and to users with intermittent connectivity.

Lie-fi is when the phone thinks there is connectivity, but there isn't. There could be a lot of hang-up points in the journey over a network, if something along the way fails or runs slowly then the whole thing fails or runs slowly. We cannot predict what may go wrong, all we can do is send a request and wait for the response. This leaves the user with nothing in between, but we can do better!
