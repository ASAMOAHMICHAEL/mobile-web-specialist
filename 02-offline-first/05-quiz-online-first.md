  <ul>
    <li>Good Connectivity</li>
    <li>Offline</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Online first works the same with good connectivity. Things also work offline with fallbacks instead of a browser error page. However, unfortunatley because we're waiting on the network before we do anything, things are still terrible with lie-fi.
