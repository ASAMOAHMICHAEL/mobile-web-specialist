# 01.02: ACCESSING THE DISCUSSION FORUMS
Use your Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship discussion forums to post ideas about lessons and concepts, ask questions, and receive feedback from other scholarship students and Udacity mentors.

You can access the discussion forums for the Grow with Google Scholarship: Mobile Web by visiting: https://forums.udacity.com/?forum_path=c/standalone-courses/ud899-gwg

## USING THE DISCUSSION FORUMS
When you go to the discussion forum, check to see if someone else has already posted your question. If yes, then you may find an answer right away! If no one has already posted your question, go ahead and post it. An expert mentor from Udacity or even one of your classmates will follow-up to ensure you get an answer to your question!
