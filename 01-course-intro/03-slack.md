# 01.03: JOINING SLACK
A special slack group is availabel only to you and your scholarship classmates and community managers. You can use Slack to interact with classmates, ask general questions, coordinate in person meet-ups with other students, and more!

If you're new to Slack, don't worry! You'll find it's super easy to learn and that it's a great way to communicate with other students. The key way to use Slack is through "Channels," each of which focuses on a specific topic. You can join channels for introductions (where you can introduce yourself to classmates), announcements (where Udacity community managers will provide important updates), and more!
