# 01.01: SCHOLARSHIP OVERVIEW
This section welcomes you as a new student and participant in the *Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship: Mobile Web*. They explain, at a very high level, how the 3-month challenge course works.

You meet a few Program Managers for the Scholarship's team:

  - Chaitra Ramanathan
  - Nick Blumenthal
  
More than 100,000 applications were received for the scholarship program from all over the United States. Of these applications, selections were narrowed down to a group of 10,000 passionate, motivated, and resiliant scholars.

## HOW THE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM WORKS
In the first phase of the program, you have 3-months to complete a Udacity challenge course in either web or Android development. During the course, you will have access to Udacity Mentors who are available to answer your questions and provide guidance in the scholarship discussion forums. You will also be invited to join a private Slack channel, where you can connect with your peers in the program, share your progress, get feedback, and ask questions.

In addition, you have the chance to qualify for a follow-up 6-month scholarship to a nanodegree program. These scholarships will be awarded based on your progress and performance in this initial 3-month challenge course. As well as your contributions to the student community. So, be sure to cover all the concepts in the course, complete all programming exercises along the way, and help your fellow students by answering their questions in the forums or on Slack.

One of the best parts of this scholarship is the community you and your classmates will build. Make sure to take advantage by asking questions, answering questions, and engaging with other students.

Congratulations and welcome!
